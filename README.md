Can't get your mind set on a wallpaper? Meet Bing Wallpaper for iOS. It exists for Windows and Android, and now Apple users can also enjoy Bing's daily images. The wallpapers change _automatically_ with the power of Shortcuts on iOS 15. And the first thing you'll see in the morning is a small banner with some info about the image. You can long-press on the notification to see more info, and learn something new.

It's also perfectly optimized for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, so the focus of the image is always front and center. iPad users receive the 4K image, while iPhone and iPod users get the content-aware portrait image.

## Quick Start
Please follow these steps to get the shortcut working correctly.
- First, install the shortcut from the link above. (You'll go through a brief tutorial when you run it for the first time.)
- Once you've ran the shortcut and completed the interactive tutorial, it's time to setup the automation.
  - Navigate to the automation tab, and tap the "+" icon.
  - Tap "Create Personal Automation".
  - Choose "Time of Day", and enter a time that works for you. (Different regions have different update times, but I use 5 AM EST for the default.)
  - Search for the action "Text" and tap to insert it. Enter the number 0 in the box that appears.
  - Next, search for the action "Run Shortcut" and tap to insert it. Choose "Bing Wallpaper for iOS" in the box that appears.
  - Finally, tap next, and disable "Ask Before Running", and "Notify When Run".

## Add to Home Screen/Widget
For quick access, it's possible to add the shortcut to your homescreen or widget.
- To add the shortcut to your homescreen:
  - Tap the elipsis menu (3 dots) on the shortcut.
  - Tap the options icon in the top right-next to the close button.
  - Tap "Add to Home Screen".
  - Give it a short name so it fits on your homescreen properly. (Ex. "Wallpaper")
  - Tap the icon to the left of the name, and select the image downloaded during the turorial. (Or download it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tech-How/Bing-Wallpaper-for-iOS/main/images/shortcut/bing-icon.png).)
  - Tap "Add".
- To add the shortcut to a widget:
  - Add the Shortcuts widget to your homescreen or today view.
  - Long-press on the widget, and choose "Edit".
  - Choose the same folder that your shortcut is in. You can move your shortcut by long-pressing it in the app.

## Changing Language/Region
During the initial import of the shortcut, you're asked if you'd like to specify a custom language and region. The format used is "language-REGION". For example, English, United States, is en-US. And Spanish, Spain, would be es-ES. Below are references from W3Schools containing all language and country codes.

## Privacy Notice
The first time you run the shortcut, you will be promped to allow access to "On my iPhone", or "On my iPad". This access is needed to remember your settings, and allow the shortcut to save data for use on next launch. Upon initial startup, a folder is created here named "Bing Wallpaper". Below is a list of all files created and how they are used:
