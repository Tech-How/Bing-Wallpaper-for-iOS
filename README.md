Can't get your mind set on a wallpaper? Meet Bing Wallpaper for iOS. It's a thing for Windows, and a thing for Android, and now Apple users can also enjoy the beautiful images Bing has to offer. The wallpapers change _automatically,_ with the power of Shortcuts on iOS 15. And the first thing you'll see in the morning is a small banner with some info about the image. You can long-press on the notification to learn more, and see what's going on in the world.

It's also perfectly optimized for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, so the focus of the image is always front and center.
