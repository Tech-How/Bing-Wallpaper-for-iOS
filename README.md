Can't get your mind set on a wallpaper? Meet Bing Wallpaper for iOS. It's a thing for Windows, and a thing for Android, and now Apple users can also enjoy the beautiful images Bing has to offer. The wallpapers change _automatically,_ with the power of Shortcuts on iOS 15. And the first thing you'll see in the morning is a small banner with some info about the image. You can long-press on the notification to learn more, and see what's going on in the world.

It's also perfectly optimized for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, so the focus of the image is always front and center. iPad users receive the 4K image, while iPhone and iPod users get the content-aware portrait image.

## Quick Start
There's a few steps to get it setup correctly, but I'll walk you through it.
- First, install the shortcut from the link above. (You'll go through a brief tutorial when you run it for the first time.)
- Once you've ran the shortcut and completed the interactive tutorial, it's time to setup the automation.
  - Navigate to the automation tab, and tap the "+" icon.
  - Tap "Create Personal Automation"
  - Choose "Time of Day", and enter a time that works for you. (Different regions have different update times, but I use 5 AM EST for the default.)
  - Search for the action "Text" and tap to insert it. Enter the number 0 in the box that appears.
  - Next, search for the action "Run Shortcut" and tap to insert it. Choose "Bing Wallpaper for iOS" in the box that appears.
  - Finally, tap next, and disable "Ask Before Running", and "Notify When Run".

## Add to Home Screen/Widget
For quick access, it's possible to add the shortcut to your homescreen or widget.
- To add the shortcut to your homescreen:
  - Tap the elipsis menu (3 dots) on the shortcut.
  - Tap the options icon in the top right-next to the close button.
  - Tap "Add to Home Screen".
